      q: "What's the difference between static content and dynamic content?",
      a: `
Static Content:

- Static content is fixed and doesn't change unless manually updated.
- Examples include text, images, and videos that are the same for every visitor.
- Think of it like a printed brochure – the information stays the same until you print a new version.

Dynamic Content:

- Dynamic content changes based on user interactions or other factors.
- Examples include personalized greetings, live data feeds, and user-specific recommendations.
- Think of it like a conversation – the information can change based on who you're talking to and what they say.

In summary, static content is like a snapshot that remains constant, while dynamic content is more interactive and can change in real-time based on various inputs.

Wix and similar platforms are great for getting started quickly, but they have limitations that can hold you back as your business grows. Here are some reasons to consider working with me instead:
